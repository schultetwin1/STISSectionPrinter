# STIS Section Printer

The Subaru Technical Information System (STIS) has HTML-based versions of
Service Manuals for Subaru Vehicles.

These HTML service manuals allow you to print a chapter or subsection of the
service manual but not the full section.

This extension will add a "Section" button to the "Print" submenu and generate
the printable full section.
